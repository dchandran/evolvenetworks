/** 
 * Methods for reading SBML from files and text strings.
 * <p>
 * <em style='color: #555'>
This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
equivalent in terms of SBML components.  This class is not prescribed by
the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
defined in SBML.
</em>

 * <p>
 * The {@link SBMLReader} class provides the main interface for reading SBML
 * content from files and strings.  The methods for reading SBML all return
 * an {@link SBMLDocument} object representing the results.
 * <p>
 * In the case of failures (such as if the SBML contains errors or a file
 * cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the {@link SBMLErrorLog} object
 * kept in the {@link SBMLDocument} returned by {@link SBMLReader}.  Callers should check
 * for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose provided on
 * {@link SBMLDocument}.
 * <p>
 * For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++,
 * this file also defines two global functions, readSBML() and
 * readSBMLFromString().  They are equivalent to creating an {@link SBMLReader}
 * object and then calling
 * the {@link SBMLReader#readSBML(String filename)}  or
 * {@link SBMLReader#readSBMLFromString(String xml)}   methods, respectively.

  /**
   * Equality comparison method for SBMLReader.
   * <p>
   * Because the Java methods for libSBML are actually wrappers around code
   * implemented in C++ and C, certain operations will not behave as
   * expected.  Equality comparison is one such case.  An instance of a
   * libSBML object class is actually a <em>proxy object</em>
   * wrapping the real underlying C/C++ object.  The normal <code>==</code>
   * equality operator in Java will <em>only compare the Java proxy objects</em>,
   * not the underlying native object.  The result is almost never what you
   * want in practical situations.  Unfortunately, Java does not provide a
   * way to override <code>==</code>.
   *  <p>
   * The alternative that must be followed is to use the
   * <code>equals()</code> method.  The <code>equals</code> method on this
   * class overrides the default java.lang.Object one, and performs an
   * intelligent comparison of instances of objects of this class.  The
   * result is an assessment of whether two libSBML Java objects are truly 
   * the same underlying native-code objects.
   *  <p>
   * The use of this method in practice is the same as the use of any other
   * Java <code>equals</code> method.  For example,
   * <em>a</em><code>.equals(</code><em>b</em><code>)</code> returns
   * <code>true</code> if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are references to the
   * same underlying object.
   *
   * @param sb a reference to an object to which the current object
   * instance will be compared
   *
   * @return <code>true</code> if <code>sb</code> refers to the same underlying 
   * native object as this one, <code>false</code> otherwise

  /**
   * Reads an SBML document from a file.
   * <p>
   * If the file named <code>filename</code> does not exist or its content is not
   * valid SBML, one or more errors will be logged with the {@link SBMLDocument}
   * object returned by this method.  Callers can use the methods on
   * {@link SBMLDocument} such as SBMLDocument.getNumErrors() and
   * {@link SBMLDocument#getError(long n)}  to get the errors.  The object returned by
   * {@link SBMLDocument#getError(long n)}  is an {@link SBMLError} object, and it has methods to
   * get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as
   * well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
   * levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
   * documentation for {@link SBMLError} for more information.
   * <p>
   * If the file <code>filename</code> could not be read, the file-reading error will
   * appear first.  The error code can provide a clue about what happened.
   * For example, a file might be unreadable (either because it does not
   * actually exist or because the user does not have the necessary access
   * priviledges to read it) or some sort of file operation error may have
   * bee reported by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check
   * for these situations using code such as the following:
   * <div class='fragment'><pre>
   * {@link SBMLReader}  reader = new {@link SBMLReader}();
   * {@link SBMLDocument}  doc  = reader.readSBML(filename);
   * 
   * if (doc-&gt;getNumErrors() &gt; 0)
   * {
   *   if (doc-&gt;getError(0)-&gt;getId() == XMLError.FileUnreadable)
   *   {
   *     // Handle case of unreadable file here.
   *   } 
   *   else if (doc-&gt;getError(0)-&gt;getId() == XMLError.FileOperationError)
   *   {
   *     // Handle case of other file error here.
   *   }
   *   else
   *   {
   *     // Handle other cases -- see error codes defined in XMLErrorCode_t
   *     // for other possible cases to check.
   *   }
   * }</pre></div>
   * <p>
   * If the given filename ends with the suffix <code>'</code>.gz' (for example, 
   * <code>'myfile</code>.xml.gz'), the file is assumed to be compressed in <em>gzip</em>
   * format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.
   * Similarly, if the given filename ends with <code>'</code>.zip' or <code>'</code>.bz2', the
   * file is assumed to be compressed in <em>zip</em> or <em>bzip2</em> format
   * (respectively).  Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read
   * uncompressed.  Note that if the file is in <em>zip</em> format but the
   * archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the
   * archive will be read and the rest ignored.
   * <p>
   * @param filename the name or full pathname of the file to be read.
   * <p>
   * @return a pointer to the {@link SBMLDocument} created from the SBML content.
   * <p>
   * @see SBMLError
   * <p>
   * @note LibSBML versions 2.x and 3.x behave differently in error
   * handling in several respects.  One difference is how early some errors
   * are caught and whether libSBML continues processing a file in the face
   * of some early errors.  In general, libSBML 3.x stops parsing SBML
   * inputs sooner than libSBML 2.x in the face of XML errors because the
   * errors may invalidate any further SBML content.  For example, a
   * missing XML declaration at the beginning of the file was ignored by
   * libSBML 2.x but in version 3.x, it will cause libSBML to stop parsing
   * the rest of the input altogether.  While this behavior may seem more
   * severe and intolerant, it was necessary in order to provide uniform
   * behavior regardless of which underlying XML parser (Expat, Xerces,
   * libxml2) is being used by libSBML.  The XML parsers themselves behave
   * differently in their error reporting, and sometimes libSBML has to
   * resort to the lowest common denominator.
   * <p>
   * @note To read a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and
   * linked with the <a href='http://www.zlib.net/'>zlib</a> library at
   * compile time.  It also needs to be linked with the <a
   * href=''>bzip2</a> library to read files in <em>bzip2</em> format.  (Both of
   * these are the default configurations for libSBML.)  Errors about
   * unreadable files will be logged if a compressed filename is given and
   * libSBML was <em>not</em> linked with the corresponding required library.
   * <p>
   * @note SBMLReader.hasZlib() and SBMLReader.hasBzip2() can be used to
   * check whether libSBML has been linked with each library.
