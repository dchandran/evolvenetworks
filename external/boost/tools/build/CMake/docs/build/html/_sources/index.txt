About this documentation
========================

This documentation was created with `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.  

The source is in the restructuredtext files in subdirectory
``tools/build/CMake/docs/source/``.  Hack on them (see the
`documentation for Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_).
When you're ready to see the html::

  make html

Once you've written a ton of docs, push them someplace where I can see
them (or use ``git diff`` to send a patch).
